# Hi. I'm xthemystik.

I am an (albeit ambitious) developer with one goal in mind- creating tomorrow's software. And with that goal in mind, my code will reflect this. I am working on a quantum key distribution system (essentially a system for secure communications), a host of exploits and other malware (mostly reworks, but with a few original ideas thrown in here, such as a SMBv3.2 compression exploit, a "retroviral" botnet system, and a GenAI prompting exploit), and a custom neural network designed to weigh datapoints in a new way. 

# Follow me on my path to attaining pipe dreams

I may be a niche and overconfident developer, but I want to work my hardest to bring my code to the next level. If you see any bugs, always contact me at xthemystic73@gmail.com, or follow me on X (@xthmystik) or Instagram (@xthemystik).
